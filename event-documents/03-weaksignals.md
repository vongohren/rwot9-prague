## Definitions

What terms did we find confusing or holding us back?

We provided new definitions and/or discussions of these terms:

1. decentralized
2. the cloud
3. identity (as an emergent property)
4. trust 
5. decentralized (as distinct between political and logical)
6. interface (as something we don't understand)
7. self (as a result of discussions about agency)
8. identity / fiduciary (the legal definition)
9. compliance (with international & national standards) / pairwise ephemeral relationships
10. delegation

## Group Thoughts

What did we think of other peoples' definitions? Here were some group thoughts:

**Decentralized:**
* Difference between distributed and decentralized is not well understood, and it's not one size fits all.
* Distributed systems can have a learning capacity that decentralized systems don't: learnings can propogate, but failures aren't catastrophic. So we want to not just look at lack-of-corruption, but also improvements for learning capacity.

**Fiduciary:**
* Fiduciary is little used in this community and should be used more
* Who does the suing? Decentralized entities?
* Self-sovereign means to us not being subject to rules of external sovereigns. We're trying to create new systems that are not necessarily rooted in jurisdictional governments. So fiduciary might not be a legal obligation
* Split contracts can really influence this. They are in two parts: a computer-code contract that enforces itself; and natural language prose for humans to interpret under dispute (and which could be a jurisdictional legal contract). Because we can't turn some things into computer code, like "best effort" or "good faith".
* Delegate should be proxied with "skin in the game" to correrlate best interest

**Government:**
* We are eventually trying to reinvent the rule of law.

**Identity:**
* At what point do we have who-we-are reified in our smart phones or similar objects? When do we make it a higher standard to take away smart phones or similar objects, as opposed to other items?
* Identity is not a solid, discrete thing: it's very emergent, a property of interaction. We have troubles porting emergent property of identity into digital space.
* Which goes back to the idea of [functional identity](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/functional-identity-primer.md).

**Machines:**
* Is the person the only one able to learn? Where can the self-sovereign machine start to learn?
* Often machines learn in ways we don't like.
* Are machines self-sovereign if they hold their own keys? Can they participate in contracts? What are motivations of people writing the code?

**Pairwise:**
* Are pairwise DIDs not on the blockchain? Everyone has different understandings.
