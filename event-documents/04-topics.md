# Topic Ideation

We are trying to get people to completed papers, from shortly after
the event, to in the next several months.

We are open to many different types of products, from papers to code and even graphic novels!

This is a collaborative event, so we want to have at least two people
involved in any work, But we want more to give papers a chance to
finish.

We need leaders who can help drive work during workshop. And to have
everyone contribute in a collaborative way. The leader makes sure
everyone is at least heard, and integrate if possible, though not
everything will be in the final product. (The leader at the event may
be different from the Lead Author who helps to finish the final paper
afterward.)

We have precise rules for copy protection (CC-BY) and AMA attribution.

Successful papers will have precise, tightly focused abstract and
people who have similar goals (but still very diverse options) and
which don't have scope creep.

If you don't work well with group, don't worry about moving away from
them, as we've had groups form and write papers on later days in the
past.
