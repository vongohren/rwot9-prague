# Final Plenary

## Final Reports

What was the coolest thing about your paper or learned?

### Alice Abuses VCs

Instead of giving best practices, decidied to tell a story.

### Blockcerts V3

Discussing importnce of blockchain in the VC world.

### Concerns for Minorities

Going through old papers. Seeing what's missing, and going from there.

### Decentralized Identity as a Meta-Platform

Transaction-cost reductions could be used in many contexts

### DID Resolution

Just working on existing resolution spec and wrote some PRs. Talked
about DID URL dereferencing. Made progress!

### DID:HC

Challenges with shifting contexts. Good news: ending up where they
started, and easy to provide a driver for universal resolver.

### Issuer-Independent Verification

Cool thing was collaboration!

Problems of interoperability, so need open verification system that
could be used on any VCs.

### Minimum Viable Protocol for Decentralization

Being able to define something that's minimally viable is the coolest!

### Proof of Personhood

Exciting to find people interested in topic and producing a paper!

### The Real Problem with Centralization

The big aha was the usefulness for individuals. We haven't automated
processing of the huge amount of information on the internet, and
centralized systems don't help that.

### Reputation Interpretation

Reputation is a bit calcified right now, and trying to shift out of
that into a weirder focus.

### Rubric for Decentralization of DID Methods

We untied pretzel of how to deal with method goverrnance.

### P2P Lending

Shared commitment to simplicity of system was cool.

### Encrypted Data Vault

Have a solution that could really work. For a lot of stuff that's all in come. Hope for interop or convergence!

### Secure User Interfaces

There will always be misalignment with user's expectations. Pleased in
using Mastodon as an example and offering it more generally.

### Petnames

Chris discovered that he needed to finish a paper from a year and a
half ago for this one! Aha!

### Shamir Secret Sharing

Last time, core paper on Shamir Secret Sharing best practices didn't
get done. (But got code, that's shipping in Trezor-T, and that's a
direct result of spring event.) So now, have a better idea of future
issues, and are figuring out how to do more with work-to-date.

Aha is that are more of these papers where we'll need to go back to previous

### BTCR Dammit!

Been working on it for a while, and have a deadline now, because BTCR
was selected as issuer DID method for DIF.

Writeup will just be what we've done. 

## Insights

Any last insights?

* Credentials may not satisfy all needed checks in some situations. For example, an expired passport could still have value. So, credentials are not necessarily black and white.

## Appreciations

Thanks to our sponsors.

We ended with some appreciations and hopes for the future.
