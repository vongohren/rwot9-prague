## Feedback

### What Do We Do Well?

* GitHub (but there's argument)
* Four days is more justifiable in costs for flight (x2)
* Demo Night
* Support for non-technical members
* Choose Your Adventure
* Soft Skills (x2)
* Productive Outcomes
* Discussion/recognition of culture biases
* Pacing: timeline, but not super strict
* Enough freedom in the schedule
* More space for introverts

### What Can We Improve

* Should have a GitHub tutorial or helper
* WEIRD, western, educated, industrial, rich, and democratic, is not representative of planet and we need to expand identity beyond that
* Intimidating
* Apologies felt coerced
* Signal channels feels exclusive
* Lacking Building Stuff
* Methodology or facilitation for getting people to work together even if they disagree
* More focused worktime, without as much moving around: better worked when we had two 1.5 hour sessions in a row, as opposed to two 1.5 hour sessions separated by something else
* Lack of a printed schedule
* Continuity of topic papers
* Wish there were a way to keep talking outside of events
* Perverse incentive with topic papers, then we come to conference and people are encouraged to work together
* We don't present our topic papers
* Terminology, especially with people using different words
* Announce events sooner
* Have someone help coordinate
* We need more sponsorships to help support the workshop
