# Day Three

Our scheduling was flexible today, as we spent the morning at
Mandatory Fun activities.

In the afternoon, we took a bit of time for some group work, largely
focusing on ahas.

## Ahas

* Text-only Bitcoin wallet was useful to blind person, 
* The work being done on demos is amazing for how fast it's maturing. 
* Identify roles in the system: don't get stuck in "layer cake". 
* People with different expertise multiply the work we do here.
* There may be a difference between how Americans and Europeans work. This can be a very valuable experience, because we can surmount these differences.
* _The Cultural Map_ can talk about how your culture impacts how you communicate.
* There is value in incrementalism: we started with seed ideas and faith and now we're getting to point where things are more concrete.
* The cross-pollination is a wonderful experience.

## Soft Skills

This is an intellectual community that thinks fast.

We have associations with things. When these get set off, we
often don't realize it.

We can say "I'm sorry", and it's not just about taking
responsilbity. It's also about apologizing.

So we spent some time offering apologies and talking about them.

## Reports from Work

Rather than doing full report-out, we gave people the option to offer
ahas from their work briefly.

* One group forgot about diagrams.
* The Agent Minimal Protocol group is looking for feedback from the community.

## Tomorrow 

Noon will be the end of our writing tomorrow.

Then we'll have a long lunch and talk.

By 4pm tomorrow we need draft in GitHub.

Dinner is at 7.30pm today; dinner is at 8pm tomorrow, for show and dinner.
