# Day Two Intro

## Logistical Details

During our second day we'll have an early end (4pm), followed by a
demo night (8pm). We also have Choose Your Own Adventure today, at
11am, which will give other people chances to demo.

We'll be doing community feedback on Friday via a paid lunch on Friday.

Jakub will be interviewing people for 10-15 minutes in the recording
studio over the next few days. He will be asking about roadblocks and
peoples takes on self-sovereign identity.

## Ahas or Cool Tips

We had fun and intriguing conversations about a variety of topics:

* How reputation systems often only record positive events.
* How reputation can relate to physical safety.
* That similar architectures are being used on digital wallets, and we'd like to tease out commonality.
* That it's being assumed that signatures are from one key and represent one person, and that's not the future.
* You can't prove that a signature is just from one person!
* The number of registered DID methods is shocking, and they're explained by prose! The proliferation is creating a nightmare for DIDs to achieve their goals.
* Decentralization is not about DIDs, but about agents.
* Concern over people breaking up groups because they couldn't come to agreement. 
* A question: which DID Document is official if a blockchain forks?
* Always admired corporations that get on board changes that will reinvent their whole business; but it never occurred that governments might similarly get onboard for their replacement systems.
* This is a _long_ game.

And some intriguing stuff about Prague:

* It wasn't that long ago that there was a reputation system in play, very forcefully, here in Prague. Under the communists.
