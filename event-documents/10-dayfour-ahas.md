# Day Four Kick Off

## Tips & Ahas

* _Race After Technology_ is about how racism ends up in technology even when we don't mean it to.
* There's a psychological bias toward white, well-educated, well-off males in the west, and that bias extends to our technology. WEIRD = acronym. 
* Phillip Sheldrake has written a great critique of our community.
* Keep doing what we learned about yesterday in "soft skills".
* It would be helpful to newcomers to this community if it were more clear what the advantages of self-sovereign identity are.
* We're trying to restore humanity to the internet, and the thing holding us back is the inability to work together.
* We have a lot of idealogical discussions about things such as mental models, and we need to focus more on what the problems are how we can solve them. Everything else is a means to that solution.
* Shared language is an important part of our job.

### Announcements

* Holochain hackathon _here_ this weekend. Starting this evening right after RWOT.
* ActivityPubConf is also this weekend, but already booked to capacity. But we think it's important for these communities to work together: we need decentralized networks for decentralized identities to work!
   * We need to work with other organizations like this, because RWOT has a real size limit at 60-90 people.
