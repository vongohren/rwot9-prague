## Abstract

So often when discussions arise about centralization and specifically about decentralized networks, the issue is framed through the lens of corruption or concentration of power. While these are significant problems, there is a separate issue that may ultimately be of greater importance: centralized systems have significant limitations in their capacity to adapt and respond. At present, humans are facing a world with increasingly complex challenges that our centralized systems (institutions, but also our existing digital communication systems) are not proving capable of responding to.  In this paper, we will articulate the difference between a centralized network, a decentralized network, a distributed network and an ecosystem, and articulate the ways in which an ecosystem, in which agents are able to bridge between multiple networks has significant advantages in terms of innovation and adaptation.  This is a result of an asymmetry between the propagation of learnings (experiments that prove contextually useful to those that try them are able to spread rapidly via those who also find them useful) and the propagation of failures (experiments that prove costly or useless tend not to propagate much further than those who find them to be problematic).  Contexts vary, and so there is no one-size-fits-all set of information that will be appropriate.  However, in an agent-centric ecosystem which would include distributed identity processes, participants are able to iteratively improve their sensing and coordination capacities over time, resulting in increasingly capable coordination of efforts and high responsiveness to shifts in the environment.
