# Minimum Viable Protocol for Decentralization
*Snorre, Victor, Adrian*

Alice wants to become self sovereign. Alice’s needs vary, but to get into decentralization she needs an agent. This agent has to be represented as some kind of physical option that she can prove the control over her self sovereignty. This agent can be mobile, biometric or other existing communication protocols. It might be a trusted execution environment online.

Alice’s agent then controls access to one or more persistent resources that are typically separate from her agent.

We want to define a couple of simple agents and needed components to make Alice self sovereign, creating a minimum viable protocol for decentralization. Making it clear to the community how one can enable self-sovereignty where there is a differentiation of agent capabilities.
