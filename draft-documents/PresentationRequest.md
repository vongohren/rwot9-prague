## Abstract
This paper looks to define and implement in a POC the request by a verifier to challenge a holder for a held claim or claims. 
The mechanism will focus explicitly on the domain of Verifiable Credentials but should do a best effort to facilitate future extensibility.
Existing implementations and prior art will be examined to derive an understanding of generally accepted approaches.  
The paper will take into consideration the existing published specifications and directions for sharing such information IDHubs, Credential Manager, Hyperledger Aries, DIF Interop Project etc.
