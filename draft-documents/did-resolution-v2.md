# Abstract

We will work on the next version of the DID Resolution spec (v0.2) and add/improve various issues that have been discussed recently and that are critical for ongoing implementation efforts.

This includes: DID Resolver architectures, trustable DID Resolver software, versioning matrix parameters, immutable DID URLs for keys, the DID URL dereferencing algorithm, and resolution metadata.
