## Abstract

One important economic implication of a new network scaling law for meta-platforms is that the network effect benefits of cooperation may be advantageous to centralized aggregation (non-cooperation) [[1]][[2]]. An *open interoperable portable decentralized identity framework is a prime candidate for a meta-platform*.  Significant momentum has been developing behind a universal decentralized identity system based on open standards. A proto-meta-platform as it were. The standards include the W3C supported DID (decentralized identifier) and verifiable credential standards [[14]][[21]]. Associated industry groups include the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), Sovrin Foundation, and HyperLedger-Indy/Aries/Ursa [[15]][[16]][[18]][[19]][[20]]. A meta-platform is a platform that enables and fosters participant controlled value transfer across and among other platforms and participants [[1]]. Because platforms are a type of network, a meta-platform enables network of network effects. Network-of-network effects may be the most valuable kind of network effects especially for participants on the associated platforms.

The purpose of this paper is to foster awareness of the economic benefits of cooperation and the crucial role decentralized identity may play in unleashing historic new sources of value creation and transfer.


## Introduction

Meta-platforms are enabled by technology that provides contextual value transitivity, in other words, value transfer between platforms or indiviudal participants on different platforms [[1]]. Contextual value transitivity includes interoperability both intra-context (same) and more importantly inter-context (cross). By context we mean some combination of application domain (set of products and services), and network of participants. Typically compatibility is a type of interoperability that only applies to the same context (intra-context) i.e. competing products and services on the same network of participants. Meta-platforms leverage interoperability between platforms that allow the transfer of value not just within the same set of applied products, services and network of participants (intra-context) but between different applied products, services and networks of participants (inter-context). In this sense, one could say that meta-platforms enable trans-contextual value creation and capture.

The final essential feature of meta-platforms is that the value transfer between platforms is under the control of participants not the platform administrators [[1]]. It is the anti-thesis of lock-in [[2]][[7]][[13]]. Participant control implies some degree of decentralization. More simply, contextual transitivity measures the ease (transaction cost) to which participant value in one context is transferrable to another by the participant [[4]][[5]]. The unique feature of contextual transitivity is that even with different application domains including incompatible products and services, participant value transfer between platforms may still occur [[1]]. In this sense meta-platforms also benefit from cooperative value transfer and hence cooperative network of network effects. Another way to think of it is that a meta-platform enables user controlled cooperation among a cooperating set of platforms.


An open decentralized identity (reputation) system is a prime candidate for a meta-platform. Significant momentum has been developing behind a universal decentralized identity system based on open standards. A proto-meta-platform as it were. The standards include the W3C supported DID (decentralized identifier) and verifiable credential standards [[14]][[21]]. Associated industry groups include the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), Sovrin, and HyperLedger-Indy/Aries/Ursa[[15]][[16]][[17]][[18]][[19]][[20]]. 

A meta-platform is a platform of platforms that enables network of network effects. Participant control means that participants may form customized or bespoke virtual platforms of their own choosing. These virtual platfroms aggregate and/or amplify their value across multiple platforms. Participant control better balances the interests of participants and platform operators. It provides a check on exploitation while increasing the value of the platform to both participants and operators due to increased attractiveness [[7]][[13]].

The concept is that value can be aggregated from extreme customization in the long-tail [[8]]. This is contextual value capture within a tail. Meta-platforms provide long-tail meta-network effects by enabling participants to extract or provide value on multiple long-tails (inter-tail-context) [[1]]. This is a network effect that enables value capture from multiple long-tails each which in turn is enabled by a network effect on a context specific long-tail value distribution. In other words a type of network of networks effect.

Blockchain technology has the potential to truly revolutionize network computing and associated markets such as finance, supply chain, social etc. One of its main attractions has been its promise of bringing more virtuous and trustworthy governance as a result of more decentralized control of the underlying systems. Decentralized control has the potential to cause a leveling effect that more fairly distributes value to users, limits exploitation, removes barriers to entry, and increases opportunities for disruptive innovation and value creation. But like any new technology that portends to provide such a leveling effect, blockchain has so far failed to live up to many of its promises. It’s still really early however and this article discusses ways some of those promises may be fulfilled via cooperative meta-platforms.

A concern comes from the fact that other leveling technologies, such as communication networks, first started as decentralized but then become more centralized over time with the associated value capture eventually becoming concentrated into a few very large business entities with higher rates of value extraction. This historic cyclic behavior is well documented in The  Square and the Tower and the Master Switch [[9]][[10]]. One can argue that the internet which started as a great leveler due to decentralized networking has now resulted in most of its value being concentrated in a handful of companies, namely, Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft each with valuations near one trillion dollars. Once centralization occurs innovation and value creation decrease and value extraction increases to the detriment of the average user .

One way to combat such centralization is with regulation. The breakup of AT&T is a largely successful example of a regulatory approach to restoring more decentralization that resulted in more innovation, lower costs and overall greater benefits to telecommunication users. Regulatory approaches, however, often come with very large deleterious side effects. What would be better instead is market driven decentralization. Appropriate applications of blockchain technology may enable such market drivers.

This paper examines one blockchain enabled technology and market driver for decentralization called an identity meta-platform. It defines and discusses how an identity meta-platform may provide a potent force for decentralization. Meta-platforms benefit from network of networks effects. The paper discusses how those may occur and the value they may bring via an identity meta-platform. It also discusses the network scaling law for meta-platforms and examines why the cooperating members of a decentralized identity meta-platform may eat (out-compete) centralized identity platforms [[1]]. With a decentralized identity meta-platform technology we may for the first time in history be able to break the cycle of centralization.

An early paper outlined the potential for identity to be a meta-system [3]. The difference is that a meta-platform enables value transfer between platforms whereas a meta-system enables interoperability between systems. Because interoperability or portability may be essential to meta-platforms, a meta-platform might therefore be a super set of a meta-system. More specifically, a meta-system is a system-of-systems whilst a meta-platform is a platform-of-platforms for economic transactions [[1]].



## Trust Transactions Cost in current Systems

One common approach to understanding business processes is via the model of transaction costs. Business value comes from reducing net transaction costs. Transaction costs may be grouped into three classes, these are triangulation, transfer, and trust [[4]][[5]]. Of these trust may be the most important, especially for a meta-platform. Without trust, platforms as well as physical and digital value chains would not exist.

However, that trust has been historically difficult, and costly, to establish. Trusted suppliers are thoughtfully selected and managed, as well as monitored and certified for quality, reliability and consistency. Regulators demand certifications and audits to ensure that best practices are followed, and companies such as TÜV, Underwriters Laboratories or Intertek conduct inspections and provide quality certifications. At the end of the value chain or as a participant of a platfrom, customers purchase products because they trust the quality of the brand, which is the key differentiator for many companies.

The immense volumes of data generated by global supply chains – if properly mined in a verifiable way – can help to establish the trustworthiness of a given value chain processes and its resulting products. However, the process requires numerous manual interventions and the involvement of many parties and its facilitation across multipe platforms. 

Providing such assurances in today’s world imposes a hidden (and growing) “trust tax” on either local or worldwide supply chain participants. From the use of “conflict-free” raw materials, to Six Sigma manufacturing practices, to Independent Standards Organization (ISO) certifications, to the validity of shipping or purchase orders – the work of verifying all these characteristics requires reams of paperwork, endless e-mails and phone calls, and costly site visits and audits. These cumbersome activities reduce productivity and efficiency throughout the economy, making it more expensive, complex and time-consuming for customers and suppliers to find and do business with one another.

We believe there is a simpler, less costly and more efficient way to establish trust in value chains, using blockchain and decentralised idenitity to establish credential based trust among participants that have never met bevor and E2E verifiable audit trails along a give value chains . 

This white paper demonstrates how current W3C decentrlised idenitifiers and verifiable credentials in combination with agents, interaction protocolls and wallets define a "metaplatform" that scales trust  participants in the wider ecosystem. This approach can slash the “trust tax,” starting with participants agreeing to implement and follow the existing decentralised idenitity standards and their future developments. This decentralised approach does not to build another aggregator platfom or blockchain solution. 


## Real World Example: Secure Logistics Systems

Multiple global logistics consortia are trying to establish so called secure logistics system for verifiable shipment tracking, process automation and verifiable business transactions across multiple entities.

Despite the fact that global logistics companies are attempting to leverage  decentralized technology they are still constrained by their confined partner system boundaries that prevent full decentralisation. 

Let's assume the following scenario for verifiable logistics transactions which is based on a real world example:
- UAE logistics is using their a decentrlizsed Hyperledger implementation
- EU logistics is using a consortium Ethereum Querom system UAE logistic platform 
- Nordics logistics is using IBM's tradelense 

In this scenrio the three logistics companies have challenges to establish transactions across entities on the three different platforms. A typical approach is either to convince the other partners to join my own platform or to implement complex federation gateways (which need to be trusted) among the platforms. 

A identity-based metaplatform has the potential to solve this problem as it can establish trust among the participant entities, verifiability along the supply chain and trusted business transactions:
- Credential based trust for on-boarding a previously unknow actor
- Verifiable consent and business transactions
- Data provenance for trace and track along a logistics supply chain


## Cooperative Network of Networks Effect


Metcalfe law scaling of cooperative networks
The exponential increase in value due to Metcalfe’s law scaling poses the question: What happens if two competing networks combine so that the combined network has a larger N than either network on its own? This value proposition was noted by Reed.
Suppose for example, given Metcalfe’s law scaling, that two networks of size N₁ and N₂ respectively were to combine. One way to combine would be to make their services interoperable (cooperate) or for one network to acquire the other. After combining the average value to a participant of either network N₁ or N₂ is due to the combined size of the new network and is given by,

## IoT Combinatorics – A Case for Metaplatform based on Decentralised Idenitity

Today, the Internet is probably best described as a network comprised of all interconnected objects, traditionally referring to human users and computers. When you add in the so-called Internet of Things (IoT), the number of addressable elements is in the tens of billions. 

The resulting combinatorics of possible connections between any given subgroup is an impossibly large number. Yet in today’s user journeys or business environments, agents (whether human, machine, or software) increasingly need to access, control or transact with a diverse group of these interconnected objects to achieve their goals in both the digital and physical worlds. This requires a straightforward and ubiquitous method to address, verify and connect these elements together.

> There are about 30 billion devices connected to the internet already. Today the 30 billion devices or managed by thousands and thousands of diffrent platforms. For the majority of the devices it is unpredictable in which context they will be used (owner, geography, use case, machine-2-machine interactions). There are (N×(N-1))/2 possible peer-to-peer (P2P) connections among the devices possible, i.e. O(n²). This results in ~10^21 possible connections. There are O(n³) possible connections for connecting three systems and so forth. 

At some point, this will be equally true in all business vertical areas but is especially paramount today for businesses dependent on supply chain management because of the large number of actors and multi-vendor components likely to be involved. The main impediment is that it is cumbersome for each agent to have innate knowledge of the wide assortment of different addressing nomenclatures. At some point it will become impossible.

Human or object identities are stored in multiple centralised or federated systems such as a government, ERP, IoT or manufacturing systems. From the standpoint of cryptographic trust verification, each of these centralised authorities serves as its own root of trust. An object trailing along a supply chain is interacting with multiple systems and platforms. Consequently, a new actor in any give value chain has no method to independently validate credentials of a human or attributes of an object (audit trail). 

Therefore, a universal addressing, trust verification system and associated interoperable metaplatform protocol must be utilised. To be a truly global solution, easy to use and still safe from hacking and sovereign interference, such a metaplatform scheme must include: addressing standards, reliable trust verification and independence from any vendor-defined naming API, yet still be one-to-one mappable onto it. 

> A participant controlled metaplatform based on decentralised idenitity is solving the problem of addressability and trust verification across participants involved a given value chain transaction. The potential of enabling these devices to interacte is massivley huge, many orders of magnitude bigger then Facebook as an aggregator for human interactions.


## Example Cost Reduction from Cooperation

### Onboarding costs

The original use of Metcalfe’s law was to show that even large upfront network connection costs would eventually be overcome by the exponential increase in value due to network size. The break-even point where the value of the network due to network effects to a participant is equal to the cost of joining the network is called the critical network size. Typically the major upfront cost of connecting to a platform is not the internet connection itself but the on-boarding cost of creating an account with login credentials and provisioning electronic payment.
One of the problems with decentralized blockchain technology is that in general it has increased the on-boarding costs of participants because of the difficulty in managing keys, increased regulatory friction, and more complexity. The plethora of competing (non-cooperative) blockchain platforms only heightens confusion. The result is that critical platform size may be significantly increased with the result that many blockchain platforms may never reach their critical size (break-even point).
A decentralized identity meta-platform allows those on-boarding costs to be amortized across every platform a participant chooses to join. This potentially lowers the critical platform size (break-even point) for the participant on each of the sub-platforms. This should accelerate network of network effects.

Because the primary value of a platform is to reduce transactions costs, a decentralized identity and reputation system has the potential to significantly reduce average trust transaction costs across different contexts. This may make whole families of transactions viable that were not viable before. This increases the value of the associated platforms per particpant and lowers the critical platform size. This further accelerates network of network effects.

## IoT Systems

Using the challenge of a building manager as a reference system, within a typical office building there are multiple vendor specific networks, HVAC, lighting, video monitoring and access security systems.  Each of these systems are controled by the respective vendors software systems.  The building manager is faced with having to work with three (in this case) different systems in order to manage their facility.  

Additionally, these management systems are also cloud based, the data must be tranfered up and back from the building to the respective management system.

## On Competition in Metaplatform Ecosystems

A participant owned meta platform neither allows a single entity to control it, to create a lock-in nor to monetise transations. 

Value transfer within the interoperable meta-platform ecosystem is controlled by the  participants. There is no administrator or aggregator that controls value and monetizes transactions margins. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/fQpyvCz.png)

As a consequence there is no monetisation at the core of the meta platform for a single party resulting in
- Authentic sharing economy
- Interoperability, previously unknown parties can transact in a trusted way
- Economically viable nano-transactions
- Secure, verifiable business transactions

It’s important to note how different this model is from current models for instance such as ride-sharing platforms such as Uber and Lyft. Autonomous vehicles eliminate the cost of human drivers, while decentrlized meta-platforms eliminate the middleman that matches customers with rides, charges a transaction fee and sets terms and conditions.

Corporates will establish sucesfull business models at the edge of the metplatform by competing on
- User Experience
- Algorithms and Analytics
- Implementation and Services
- Harware and Infrastructure

![](https://i.imgur.com/3Z15EQk.png)

Mobility on a decentralized meta platform may also become one of the most visible examples of a zero marginal cost economy in which owners of everything from homes to cars rent them out when not in use, driving the marginal cost of each overnight stay or trip close to zero. 

In such a world with cooperative economic drivers, trust, reputation and sustainablity become valuable and monetizable capital.

## Conclusion

In this paper we layed out that there is a economic reason for corporates to join the cooperative metaplatform. ...

[1]. Platform - A platform is a business based on enabling value-creating interactions between external producers and consumers.  The platform provides an open, participative infrastructure for these interactions and sets governance conditions for them. 

The platform’s overarching purpose: to consummate matches among users and facilitate the exchange of goods, services,  or social currency, thereby enabling , value creation for all participants.

Platforms create value by using resources they don’t own or control, as such they can grow much faster than traditional organizations.
