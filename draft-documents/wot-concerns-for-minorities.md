## Abstract

As we keep building a new web of trust, we need to remember that the needs of marginalized groups are often not heard. It’s easy to talk about access just in terms of disability, and while it is one aspect it’s also important to remember that there are other marginalized groups who are not heard because they are a minority, or they are oppressed in other ways. In this paper, we will examine the existing conversation about the concept of the Web of Trust, both at Rebooting and at adjacent communities. We will begin with an overview of existing work, leading into a discussion about what seems to be missing, and conclude with further recommendations.
