## Group 1: Abstract

Common mistakes built into reputation systems create mixed signals, confuse users, and alienate or exclude certain populations. 
Many recognize the need for trust-enhancing reputation, but carry in unconscious assumptions which undermine the effectiveness 
of their design. This document is a “how to” guide intended to help you challenge your hidden assumptions, walk you through 
critical decisions, and design an effective reputation framework.
