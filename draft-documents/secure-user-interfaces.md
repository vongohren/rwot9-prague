# Secure User Interfaces

## Abstract

As critical human activities are increasingly being conducted online such as personal and commercial communications, transmission of funds, voting, providing legally-binding digital signatures, and so on, the importance of designing interfaces that are both user-friendly and secure is growing.

Using a social messaging interface as a use case, we focus on the need to co-design user experience and underlying security foundations.

This paper has three parts.

First we will define criteria of a secure communication system including technical feasibility, ethical desirability and usability. 

We will then explore the requirements of a user interface that conveys the security of the system to users in an intuitive way, with an emphasis on inclusive design. 

We will conclude by issuing recommended design patterns and principles illustrated via best practices for decentralized applications.
