## Abstract

This paper discusses the need for, design of, and use of digital information that suggests that an entity is a unique individual human without necessarily identifying the individual. It is important not to rely on politically centralized entities for the creation of such information, in order to safeguard certain universal human rights; thus we consider only approaches that ensure a governance structure that is robust to abuse of power and preserves system integrity. This could be information that provides either a 100% guarantee, or one that provides less certainty; it could also be anonymous or pseudonymous. For example, such information could enable a decentralized voting system, distribution of a universal basic income, or ticket scalping reduction. Organizing Sybil-proof identity information in this way is associated with various risks; thus we warn against some possible paths of abuse.
